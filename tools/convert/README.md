Usage: convert.py [file.awk] [script only if no file] [-verbose]

The output will be the converted version of the provided script, which with you can do whatever you like.

If the output doesn't look correct, you can use -verbose to get more information on the steps the transpiler
is taking and where it goes wrong, but your best bet is probably just to convert your script yourself using the
table provided in the README of the main directory of the repository.
