ideas for next tests (i-run2):
100000-10 (1mil total) got the best results by a pretty big margin (10%),
	including over its flipped counterpart,
	can try something similar to this but with less total,
	or with a similar total but broken up into more dimensions (where one is still much larger)
try less of a total in general, 100 000 is the lowest we can reasonably go
	(time doesn't stay at 0), can also use this figure and above for tests with multiple arrs
take adv of the new exp notation
try to see what the effect of shifting the amounts for dimensions is,
	particularly for >2 dimensions so we're not just flipping them,
	and this time at a total closer to 1mil
total of 2bil is too much but maybe 1.5bil, can start with 1.25 even
only one test with several arrays, try more of those,
	especially against their counterparts in terms of totals, once again lowerish total
big gap between total of 1 mil and 1 bil, get somewhere around 500 mil, 750 mil, 900 mil, etc
