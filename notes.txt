Using make_const_string instead of make_malloced_string
makes a copy of an already malloced string each time,
but using make_malloced_string on the same char* 
will result in a double free, because it essentially tells
gawk to handle the freeing of the same char* a second time by
assigning that char* to a variable within a gawk program,
which then means we have no control over freeing the value;
this is bad in the case where we insert a value into the tree
but never retrieve it on the awk-level via a query,
never signaling to gawk that it's responsible for freeing it. 
A possible solution could be to check whether or not a
value is taken care of by gawk before freeing it on exit,
but this would require more memory to track this of course.

Another solution is to use value cookies, which store
a cached value such as a string, for multiple variables to
use, and which gawk knows to free seperately and only once.
However, these would also cost more memory to store, partially
for the gawk_value_cookie_t struct, but also because we would
have to track what values have already been instantiated using
yet another associative data structure. In the case where a
gawk program rarely uses the same value for the given 
variables within the program, this may actually waste more
memory than simply using make_const_string.

The only way to directly be able to update a value obtained from a 
query to the tree is if we were to also update gawk's symbol table
in addition to the actual htree(s); because of this, it's difficult
to have a straightforward solution for translating shortcuts like +=
into the extension, this branch has experimentally tried to
solve that by using awk_value_t in the internal structures instead
of foints, returning a pointer to the data that gawk also uses,
stored internally instead of constructing an awk_value_t from that
entry, Ulimately though, it seems that whatever you pass to gawk from
an extension function, it automatically garbage collects, so we run
into the same double free problem even with this approach. Going
forward, we'll try having a tree type just for numbers, to avoid any
memory management problems at all, and hopefully use much less memory
than trying to store lots of strings when only numeric types are necessary.
